# DIVI Child Theme

A clean DIVI child theme for Wordpress that can be utilised on any DIVI Theme & Page Builder Wordpress website. This theme is dependent on the DIVI Builder theme by [Elegant Themes, Inc.](https://www.elegantthemes.com/)

> A child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality and styling of another theme, called the parent theme.

A child theme allows you to make changes/customisations to the theme, but you won't lose your customisation when you update the actual theme.

## Do You Need a Child Theme

In short **no**, you do not need one. That might be controversial to some, but with a builder like DIVI there is less need for lots of CSS customisations compared to a standard Wordpress website. Then again, at [YEPYR](https://www.yepyr.com) we like best practices. And it is best practice to preserve any kind of customisation work.
